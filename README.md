Resilient-community-app
========================

mapping app for community organisations in a disaster

_Team_: Dan Lewis, Jessica Kennair

_Backend_: C#, .NET.

_Frontend_: OOJavaSript, Ajax, jQuery/UI.

Consuming leaflet API and MapBox for the mapping aspect of the project.

Points up for consideration
============================

Should users be able to have access to each others email addresses

Do we have options where the email addresses are private but users can message each other through the app

Do we need a messages dataset, a posts dataset and a user dataset or a posts dataset that is both local and global

How do we validate a users authenticity
